      <b>The</b> Caterogries of fishing I am refering can be divided into to two
      saltwater fishing and freshwater. All recreational fisherman either fish
      in one of these environments. So whats the difference essentially
      saltwater fisherman benefit greatly from the abudant ocean for example the
      fish species in the salt enivorments tend to be much bigger and harder
      fighting. You generally need stronger tackle and bigger rods which may
      cost a bit more.Nonetheless is it is worth getting out there and wether in
      the surf or on a boat to be on or near the ocean is a treat plus in my
      opinion saltwater fish taste way better then there freshwater
      <b>Cousins.</b>

    <h2 class="col-md-12 head3">Freshwater</h2>
    <p class="col-md-10 para2">
      <b>Although</b> freshwater environments are not as dramatic as the sea
      there is still plenty of action to be had.Having fished in areas around
      Gauteng I must say its quite relaxing to cast your rod into water at a
      local dam and just chill watching the clouds go by and hooking up to a fat
      carp.Evening though in my opinion freshwater fish species dont taste good
      they put up a decent fight nothing like a bass hitting your tackle or a
      monster catfish in the Vaal. Freshwater tackle is also a lot more
      affordable and easy on the wallet.In the end there is something for
      <b>everyone.</b>
