        <p class="para2">
          <b>When</b> I was younger I spent most of my spare time playing video
          games. Looking outside my room window I which the days go by as I
          played my Ps2 and I thought it would be nice to get out so I did. In
          my quest to find a outdoor recreational activity I had my first
          experince fishing on the peir in Kalk bay in Cape Town.Standing
          watching the ocean with the smelling refreshing fragrances of the sea
          and having the gusts of sea air lightly batter my body it really
          awakens your senses. Even though I didn't catch anything that day I
          was
          <b>Hooked.</b>

        <h3 class="head4">What I like about fishing</h3>
        <p class="para3">
          <b>One</b> of Favourite things about fishing would be the peace. Its
          so peaceful and relaxing to get out in nature to cast your line in the
          water and just chill and wait for the fish to start biting. Another
          thing I like about fishing would be the variety wether it be
          salt-water or fresh-water environments or different types of tackle to
          the many types of species to be caught fishing just never stops giving
          in terms of the variety if things it offers. My final point that I
          would like to add would be affordablity. Fishing is fairly affordable
          which means that almost anyone can have fish no matter what type of
          lifestyle you come from fishing is for <b>All.</b>
